Project: Recipes for The Odin Project

First Stage
This project is a minor html endeavor where I create a recipes "website" showcasing different recipes and their instructions. I will demonstrate my skils in utlizing git, html files, and web development in general.

Once complete, the project will hopefully secure my ability in creating good commits, great/well-structured html files, and forming proper files in a proper file structure. Imports, images, hyperlinks, git, and more will be used to accomplish this heavy task. Hopefully, I work on it till the very end :).
